Are you contributing to food waste?

## Indledning

People starve and human activity is heavily impacting the environment negatively, but that doesn't stop a large proportion of our food to go to waste. Whether it's in the kitchen, the supermarket or on the farmers field, food and potential food is going to waste. This is a problem on national scale, and a debate hereof discusses multiple topics including agriculture, energy production and what we can do as individuals.

## Thesis statement

How can we reduce the waste caused by food surplus?

## Redegørelse

In the modern day United States food gets thrown out. Whether it's the consumer buying products they can't consume or the farmers growing crops they can't sell, a large quantity of food is getting disposed of rather than eaten. This is a major problem, as agricultural production and biological waste disposal is a big contributer to environmental destruction and climate change.

Agricultural producers leave 33% percent of their crops unpicked and waste 40% of their production overall^1. This has multiple causes, mainly that the farmers are incentivised to grow a surplus of crops^2. Many factors like the weather can very the agricultural output. The products demanded by supermarkets can vary, therefore there can be a varied amount of produce able to be sold. Therefore does a surplus of crops act as insurance for the farmer.

Instead of ending up in landfills or incinerators biological waste can also be used for good. Biological waste material can be decomposed into fertile soil in a process know as composting. Waste can also be used by the energy industry to create biogas, a carbon neutral alternative to natural gas.

## Diskussion

Farmers grow more crops than they harvest and sell, couldn't they just plan their production better? This is a necessity in the modern economy. Farmers are forced by supermarkets to produce surplus. "Since supermarkets also often refuse to buy produce for being the wrong shape or size, this forces farmers to overplant even more"^3. Supermarkets have to sell their products to consumers, and most consumers are only willing to buy close to perfect products. Therefore the supermarkets aren't interested in crops deviating from what's considered normal by customers.

If you can just dispose of the food in environmentally friendly ways, why can't we just solve the problem with those methods? The the video "What is food waste?", Molly Lindsay, director of operants at Community Compost, list a prioritized sequence of which they would rather like to handle organic waste. Molly Lindsay says prioritizes giving excess food to either people, especially those in need, or farm animals as a way for farmers to save money on feed.

Customer preference can have a big impact on food waste. Certain crops are grown certain seasons of the year, but most of the time is caused by natural limitations. But this rarely impacts the purchasing decisions of supermarket customers. You could argue that this isn't the fault of the consumer, but more so the supermarkets. "Stores entice consumers to buy fresh produce with Instagram-ready piles and pyramids of fruits and vegetables that you’ve no doubt seen at your local supermarket"^5. While consumer side activism is undeniably positive, the impact is marginal. To make a real change in customer behaviour systemic change is needed. This is most likely in form of government laws and incentives, to align marketing efforts of supermarkets with the production capability of farmers.

## Perspektivering

The issue of food waste is likely an issue of profit incentives conflicting with morality. Another issue of that sort, was the abolition of slavery in the United States. In the 1860's, the nothern states had begun to think of slavery as immoral, but the southern states were still dependent economically on cotton production powered by slavery. "To maintain this profitable production, slaves were needed as a work force, and therefore, slavery as an institution was absolutely essential in American society at the time"^6. It made no sense at the time in the southern states at the time to get rid of slavery, because they're economy was heavily relient on cotton production. We see the same with farmers overgrowing crops today, because it simply doesn't make economic sense to do otherwise, even though it's immoral.

You could argue that slavery is more immoral as suffering of people directly caused by it. But the same could be said about food waste. Many people are suffering today because of starvation and impacts of climate change.

Slavery was abolished by violence and war between the north and south. It's very unlikely that a civil war is required to reduce food waste, but system change is needed either way, most likely through laws.

## Konklusion

The problem of food waste is a complex one, of which there aren't a singular solution. While we might blame certain parts of the food chain, it's better to look at the full picture. The problem of food waste is probably not going away anytime soon. But there are ways we can reduce the waste caused by food surplus, whether it's through individual actions or large scale systemic changes.
