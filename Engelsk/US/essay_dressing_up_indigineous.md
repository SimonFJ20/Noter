# Dressing up indigenous, hurts native americans.

Dressing up on halloween is a tradition. The costumes include everything from fictional characters, to traditional clothes of other cultures. For a while, there’s been a discussion whether dressing up as certain cultures, could be hurtful. For example, a popular debate, is whether dressing up as indigious, hurts native americans. For most people, dressing up is just about expression and fun, but many native americans are expressing their dislike for the use of native american culture as a form of humor. **Is it acceptable, dressing up as native american for halloween?**

## Redegørelse

Native Americans have been oppressed since Europeans came to America. American history is filled with discrimination, hatred and violence against Native Americans, whether it's in the form of exclusion, removal or maltreatment^[1]. The history has had a major effect on Native Americans still living in america today. For example, twenty seven percent of Native Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota are living below the poverty line^[2].

On halloween, it's tradition to put on a costume of some kind. These custome could be fictional; cartoon characters, monsters and other imaginary creatures, but they can also be inspired by different cultures throughout history. A popular choice amongst the American youth, is the a category depicting traditional Native American peoples clothes and ornaments. Because of the history and circumstances of Indigenous people today, many think this custome is unacceptable. This has sparked a heated debate concering hate, racism, differences between cultural appropreation and appreciation.

## Diskussion

Dressing up in costumes depicting another culture, can be hurtful to the culture, if the depiction is not accurate or misrepresentating. "And, most recently, country singer Kacey Musgraves sparked outrage among the Asian American community both for combining Indian and Vietnamese traditional costumes and for hypersexualizing the look."^[3] In this example Kacay Musgraves had performed in a custome, depicting another culture in a misrepresentating way. This could lead to people misunderstanding and being misinformed about the depicted culture. In this case it was the people of the culture who spoke out against it, as it is them, who affected. But one could imagine the people culture not being able to speak out against such cultural volations. This could be the case for Native Americans, therefore we need to set boundries as a collective, so that people who can't speak out, aren't hurt.

Showing off part of a foreign culture could empower the people of the culture. "“I would be so happy to see other people wear my cultural costume,” Nguyen said. “America would not be America without combining cultures. People should not forget — all these people are from all different parts of the world.”"^[4] Nguyen talks about, how she would feel positively if others wear part of her culture and show if off. She also talks about, how combining different cultures is a crucial part of American culture. Americas population is a diverse composition of people and cultures. The act of portraying another culture, could be beneficial for the culture. More people could become aware and educated about the culture, and in response become less reluctant, to recognizing oppression and hatred, and more inclined to helping the people of those cultures. But this is unfortunately only possible, on the condition, that the cultures are portrayed in an honest way, without mocking the people of the culture. And I think this could easily, be done wrong, maybe not intentionally, but still with the potential of hurting people.

## Perspektivering

Another costume sparking outrage on social media, is the so called blackface. Blackface as a term, or wearing blackface, describes the act of a person, of non-African descent, artificially coloring their face with black or brown paint, in order to portray a person of African descent. Because of the decades of oppression against people of color, blackface is recognized by the vast majority, to be an act of hate and racism. A famous case of this, was the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who under his reelection campaign, had a photo of him come out, of himself wearing blackface^[5]. Compared to blackface, Native American costumes aren't recognized as hate and oppression in the same way. No one is making the argumet that blackface helps educate the masses about people of color. Contrary to the history of Indigenous people, the history of African-Americans, and injustive of currently living people of color, is more common knowledge. I think if Native American customes potential of hurtfulness is to be recognized in the same manner as blackface, knowledge about Native American current day material conditions and brutal history has to become just as common place.

## Konklusion

America is a diverse country with many different people and cultures. Dressing up as people from other cultures can be beneficial to the culture, but it comes at major risk of harming already marginalized groups of people. Native Americans have endurred a long history of suffering, and their status in modern America, is still not on par with White Americans. Given these circumstances we can conclude, that dressing up indigenous, hurts native americans. Therefore we need help each other be inclusive and positive, when it comes to representing marginalized cultures like Native Americans.
