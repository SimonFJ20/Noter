People that dress up for fun or educational means, that is part of the first amendment of free speech.
However the culture that u dressed up as, it should not be used to promote hate speech or depicting the culture in a negative way.
An example could be that a "non Native American" dressed up as a "Native American" and started to acting stupid and taking drugs.
